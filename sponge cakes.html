	<p id="spongy">A sponge cake is a very light and simple cake whose main ingredients are mainly flour and eggs. Specifically what seperate a sponge cake from the everyday cake is the absence of milk in the recipe. One would think it would have a very hard texture because it has no milk but I beg to differ. It is the fluffiest cake you will ever taste and it is very good for the vegetarians and also and most imoportantly, the lactose intolerant. I realy prefer it to the traditional vanilla caeke because there is somethimg about its texture and also how light, fluffy and simple it is. I also really love making it it always comes out perfect. Look how apetising and fluffy it is below. I dare you to try it for it is amazingly tasty. </p>

<p id="review">This tasty cake should taste like a soft vanilla cake. It is like in the above pictures cream in colour with a  nice golden brown top. It should definitely smell fresh.</p>
